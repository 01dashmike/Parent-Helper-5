# GitHub Connection Instructions

Your project isn't reaching GitHub because the remote repository isn't configured. Here's how to connect:

## Method 1: Using Replit's GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. **Look for these options in your Replit interface:**
   - Click the **three dots menu** (⋯) in the top toolbar
   - Or find **"Version Control"** in the left sidebar
   - Or click **"Connect to GitHub"** button

2. **Follow the prompts to:**
   - Authorize Replit to access your GitHub account
   - Create a new repository named `Parent-Helper-5`
   - Choose Public or Private

## Method 2: Manual Repository Setup

1. **Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository:**
   - Repository name: `Parent-Helper-5`
   - Description: `Parent Helper 5 - React + Supabase`
   - Choose Public or Private
   - **Don't initialize** with README (you have files already)

2. **Copy the repository URL** (looks like: `https://github.com/yourusername/parent-helper-5.git`)

3. **Tell me the URL** and I'll help configure the connection

## Current Status
- ✓ Project files are ready
- ✓ Git repository is initialized
- ✗ Remote connection to GitHub not configured
- ✗ No git remote origin set

Once connected, your comprehensive baby and toddler class finder will be available on GitHub for deployment.
